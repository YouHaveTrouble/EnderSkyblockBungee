<p>EnderSkyblock is bungee-powered skyblock solution that allows 
nearly infinite scaling and spreading player islands between 
multiple instances of spigot servers using SlimeWorldManager.

<p>This is a a plugin that you put on the Bungeecord server.
Plugin that you need to put on spigot servers is here: WIP - LINK SOON

EnderSkyblock requires
<li>MySQL database
<li>At least 1 bungeecord server
<li>At least 1 spigot server under bungeecord

<p>There are probably a lot of bugs that may or may not be fixed. I created this purely as of proof of concept and do not currently plan to support if long-term.
